      Welcome to my blog! I'm a mathematics master's student in Paris with interests in mathematics, finance and machine learning topics.
    </p>
    <h2>Background</h2>

    I'm currently completing my master's degree in Financial Mathematics in Paris, where I focus on the intersection of mathematical theory and practical financial applications.

    <h2>Interests</h2>

    Beyond finance, I'm deeply fascinated by:
    <br>
    - <strong>Machine Learning</strong> — Exploring neural networks, and practical applications
    <br>
    - <strong>Mathematical Challenges</strong> — Solving complex problems and puzzles
    <br>
    - <strong>Programming</strong> — Implementing mathematical concepts through code

    <h2>Blog Focus</h2>

    This blog serves as a platform where I share:
    <br>
    - Interesting mathematical problems and my (non optimal) solutions
    <br>
    - Programming challenges I've encountered
    <br>
    - Applications of machine learning techniques
