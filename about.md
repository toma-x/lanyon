<p class="message">
  Welcome to my blog! I'm a mathematics master's student in Paris with interests in mathematics, finance and machine learning topics.
</p>

## Background

I'm currently completing my master's degree in Financial Mathematics in Paris, where I focus on the intersection of mathematical theory and practical financial applications.

## Interests

Beyond finance, I'm deeply fascinated by:

* **Machine Learning** — Exploring algorithms, neural networks, and practical applications
* **Mathematical Challenges** — Solving complex problems and puzzles
* **Programming** — Implementing mathematical concepts through code

## Blog Focus

This blog serves as a platform where I share:

* Interesting mathematical problems and my (non optimal) solutions
* Programming challenges I've encountered
* Applications of machine learning techniques

## Connect
