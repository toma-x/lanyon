## Taming the Reporting Beast: My Journey Automating Portfolio Risk Metrics with Access

For the past few months, alongside my coursework, I've been chipping away at a personal project aimed at solving a rather tedious problem: the manual compilation of weekly portfolio risk reports. What started as a simple data entry task for a small set of mock portfolios quickly ballooned into hours of spreadsheet manipulation and manual calculations each week. It was clear that a more robust solution was needed, and I decided to tackle this by building an automated reporting system using Microsoft Access.

The core issue was the sheer repetitive nature of pulling data from various sources (simulated, in my case, as CSV exports), calculating several key risk metrics, and then formatting these into a presentable report. The process was error-prone, and frankly, a significant time drain that I felt could be better spent on analysis rather than data wrangling.

**Why Access? A Pragmatic Choice**

I know Access might not be the first tool that comes to mind for "automation" projects these days, with Python and dedicated financial libraries often taking the spotlight. I did consider using Python with SQLite, or even just supercharging Excel with more advanced VBA. However, my primary constraint was familiarity and the tools readily available to me. I had some prior experience with Access from an introductory database course, and the visual interface for query building and form/report design felt less intimidating for a solo project where rapid iteration was key. Plus, the idea was to have a self-contained application, and Access seemed well-suited for this scale of data and complexity without introducing too many external dependencies. I figured if I could get the relational database structure right, the rest would follow.

**Laying the Foundation: The Database Schema**

This was where I spent a good chunk of my initial time. I knew getting the tables and relationships right was crucial. My first attempt was a bit naive; I tried to cram too much into a single `PortfolioData` table. It quickly became apparent that this wouldn't work, especially when thinking about tracking metrics over time and handling multiple assets within portfolios.

After some sketching and consulting my old database textbook (specifically the chapter on normalization), I landed on a more structured approach:

1.  `tblPortfolios`:
    *   `PortfolioID` (AutoNumber, Primary Key)
    *   `PortfolioName` (Short Text)
    *   `CreationDate` (Date/Time)
    *   `RiskTolerance` (Short Text) - e.g., Low, Medium, High

2.  `tblAssets`:
    *   `AssetID` (AutoNumber, Primary Key)
    *   `AssetTicker` (Short Text, Indexed (Duplicates OK))
    *   `AssetName` (Short Text)
    *   `AssetClass` (Short Text) - e.g., Equity, Fixed Income, Cash

3.  `tblHoldings`: This became the junction table connecting portfolios and assets.
    *   `HoldingID` (AutoNumber, Primary Key)
    *   `PortfolioID_FK` (Number, Foreign Key to `tblPortfolios`)
    *   `AssetID_FK` (Number, Foreign Key to `tblAssets`)
    *   `Quantity` (Number, Double)
    *   `PurchaseDate` (Date/Time)
    *   `PurchasePrice` (Currency)

4.  `tblMarketData`: To store daily prices for assets.
    *   `MarketDataID` (AutoNumber, Primary Key)
    *   `AssetID_FK` (Number, Foreign Key to `tblAssets`)
    *   `PriceDate` (Date/Time)
    *   `ClosingPrice` (Currency)
    *   *Constraint: I decided to make `AssetID_FK` and `PriceDate` a composite unique index to avoid duplicate price entries for the same asset on the same day.*

5.  `tblRiskReports`: To store the generated report data.
    *   `ReportID` (AutoNumber, Primary Key)
    *   `PortfolioID_FK` (Number, Foreign Key to `tblPortfolios`)
    *   `ReportDate` (Date/Time, Default Value = `Date()`)
    *   `Calculated_VaR` (Currency) - Placeholder for Value at Risk
    *   `PortfolioVolatility` (Number, Double) - e.g., Standard deviation of returns
    *   `AssetConcentration` (Number, Double) - e.g., Weight of largest holding

Setting up the relationships with referential integrity (enforcing cascade updates/deletes where appropriate) was a key step. I remember struggling a bit with the "Lookup Wizard" for foreign keys, initially creating text fields instead of number fields that properly linked, which threw some errors when I tried to enforce integrity. A quick search on an MS Access forum pointed out my mistake in data type matching.

**Populating the Database: The Initial Data Grind**

Initially, I manually entered some test data. For more substantial testing, I created mock CSV files for asset prices and holdings, then used Access's built-in import wizard. This came with its own set of minor frustrations, particularly with date formats. My CSVs had dates as `YYYY-MM-DD`, but Access defaulted to my system's `MM/DD/YYYY` setting during one import, which led to a lot of nonsensical dates until I explicitly specified the format in the import specification. Cleaning that up was a lesson in vigilance.

**The Automation Core: VBA to the Rescue (and Frustration)**

This was the most challenging but also the most rewarding part. My goal was to have a button on a form that, when clicked, would:
1.  Identify active portfolios.
2.  For each portfolio, calculate the required risk metrics based on current holdings and market data.
3.  Store these calculated metrics in `tblRiskReports`.
4.  Optionally, generate a formatted Access report.

I started by creating a simple form with a button. The VBA behind this button would orchestrate the process.

Here's a snippet of the VBA I developed to loop through portfolios and kick off the metric calculation. It's not perfect, and error handling is still a bit basic, but it formed the backbone:

```vba
Private Sub cmdGenerateReports_Click()
    Dim db As DAO.Database
    Dim rsPortfolios As DAO.Recordset
    Dim strSQL As String
    Dim currentPortfolioID As Long
    Dim reportDate As Date

    Set db = CurrentDb()
    reportDate = Date ' Use today's date for the report

    ' SQL to get all active portfolios (assuming an 'IsActive' field in tblPortfolios, which I added later)
    strSQL = "SELECT PortfolioID FROM tblPortfolios WHERE IsActive = True;"
    
    On Error GoTo ErrorHandler_cmdGenerateReports_Click

    Set rsPortfolios = db.OpenRecordset(strSQL, dbOpenSnapshot)

    If Not (rsPortfolios.BOF And rsPortfolios.EOF) Then
        rsPortfolios.MoveFirst
        Do While Not rsPortfolios.EOF
            currentPortfolioID = rsPortfolios!PortfolioID
            ' Call a separate function/sub to calculate metrics for this portfolio
            Call CalculateAndStoreMetrics(currentPortfolioID, reportDate)
            rsPortfolios.MoveNext
        Loop
        MsgBox "Risk reports generated and stored for all active portfolios for " & Format(reportDate, "yyyy-mm-dd") & ".", vbInformation
    Else
        MsgBox "No active portfolios found to process.", vbExclamation
    End If

    GoTo Cleanup_cmdGenerateReports_Click

ErrorHandler_cmdGenerateReports_Click:
    MsgBox "An error occurred: " & Err.Description, vbCritical, "Report Generation Error"

Cleanup_cmdGenerateReports_Click:
    If Not rsPortfolios Is Nothing Then rsPortfolios.Close
    Set rsPortfolios = Nothing
    Set db = Nothing
    Exit Sub

End Sub
```
One of the first major hurdles was structuring the SQL queries within VBA, especially when parameters were involved. Debugging SQL strings concatenated in VBA is not fun. I relied heavily on `Debug.Print` to output the SQL string to the Immediate Window, then copied it into a new Access query to test it directly until it worked.

**Calculating the Metrics: SQL Gymnastics and VBA Logic**

For the metrics themselves, I tried to do as much as possible using Access queries, as they are generally more efficient than iterating through recordsets in VBA for calculations.

For instance, calculating `PortfolioVolatility` (simplified here as the standard deviation of daily portfolio returns over a period) was tricky. I didn't have direct access to a `STDEV()` function over a dynamically calculated series of portfolio values in a single query step in the way I might in SQL Server or with Python's pandas.

My initial approach involved:
1.  A query to calculate daily portfolio values based on holdings and historical market data. This itself was a multi-join query that took some tweaking.
2.  Then, I thought about using VBA to pull these daily values into an array and calculate standard deviation. This felt clunky.

I searched for "Access SQL standard deviation aggregate" and found some complex solutions involving subqueries or domain aggregate functions like `DStDev`. One StackOverflow answer suggested using a temporary table to store intermediate results (like daily percentage changes) and then running `DStDev` on that. This seemed like a viable workaround.

For `AssetConcentration` (e.g., percentage value of the largest holding), I used a query grouped by `PortfolioID_FK` and `AssetID_FK` to calculate the market value of each holding, then another query with a `DSum` or a subquery to get the total portfolio value, and finally calculated the percentage. Then I used VBA to find the maximum percentage for each portfolio.

The `CalculateAndStoreMetrics` sub mentioned in the VBA above looked something like this (simplified):

```vba
Public Sub CalculateAndStoreMetrics(ByVal pID As Long, ByVal rDate As Date)
    Dim db As DAO.Database
    Dim rsMetricCheck As DAO.Recordset
    Dim strSQLCheck As String
    Dim strSQLInsert As String
    Dim calculatedVol As Double
    Dim calculatedConcentration As Double
    Dim calculatedVaR_temp As Currency ' Temporary VaR calculation

    Set db = CurrentDb()

    ' First, check if a report for this portfolio and date already exists
    strSQLCheck = "SELECT ReportID FROM tblRiskReports WHERE PortfolioID_FK = " & pID & " AND ReportDate = #" & Format(rDate, "yyyy-mm-dd") & "#;"
    Set rsMetricCheck = db.OpenRecordset(strSQLCheck, dbOpenSnapshot)

    If rsMetricCheck.EOF Then ' Only proceed if no report exists
        rsMetricCheck.Close ' Close the recordset as it's no longer needed here
        Set rsMetricCheck = Nothing ' Release the object

        ' --- Placeholder for actual metric calculation logic ---
        ' This would involve running complex queries or VBA functions
        ' For PortfolioVolatility:
        ' 1. Query to get daily portfolio values for past N days
        ' 2. VBA or further queries to calculate stdev of these values
        calculatedVol = CalculatePortfolioVolatility(pID, rDate, 30) ' Assumed function that returns volatility over 30 days

        ' For AssetConcentration:
        calculatedConcentration = CalculateAssetConcentration(pID, rDate) ' Assumed function

        ' For VaR (very simplified for this example):
        calculatedVaR_temp = calculatedVol * 2.33 * GetPortfolioMarketValue(pID, rDate) ' Simplified VaR (e.g. 99% confidence assuming normality)

        ' Now, insert the new record
        strSQLInsert = "INSERT INTO tblRiskReports (PortfolioID_FK, ReportDate, Calculated_VaR, PortfolioVolatility, AssetConcentration) " & _
                       "VALUES (" & pID & ", #" & Format(rDate, "yyyy-mm-dd") & "#, " & calculatedVaR_temp & ", " & Round(calculatedVol, 4) & ", " & Round(calculatedConcentration, 4) & ");"
        
        On Error Resume Next ' Basic error handling for the insert
        db.Execute strSQLInsert, dbFailOnError
        If Err.Number <> 0 Then
            ' Log error or display message; for now, just output to Immediate Window
            Debug.Print "Error inserting risk metrics for PortfolioID " & pID & ": " & Err.Description
            Err.Clear
        End If
        On Error GoTo 0 ' Reset error handling

    Else
        ' Report already exists, maybe log or inform user
        Debug.Print "Report for PortfolioID " & pID & " on " & Format(rDate, "yyyy-mm-dd") & " already exists."
        rsMetricCheck.Close
        Set rsMetricCheck = Nothing
    End If

    Set db = Nothing ' Clean up
End Sub
```
A significant breakthrough moment was figuring out how to correctly format date criteria in SQL strings within VBA. Using `Format(rDate, "yyyy-mm-dd")` and wrapping it with `#` symbols (e.g., `#2024-05-21#`) was something I found on a Microsoft support page after many failed attempts with direct date variable concatenation which Access SQL didn't like. Another challenge was avoiding re-calculating and re-inserting metrics if the process was run multiple times on the same day. The `strSQLCheck` and the `If rsMetricCheck.EOF Then` logic was added to handle this idempotency.

**Reflections and What's Next**

This project was a fantastic learning experience, pushing my understanding of database design, SQL, and VBA far beyond what I'd covered in classes. The biggest takeaway was the importance of breaking down a complex problem into smaller, manageable parts. The initial schema design felt overwhelming, but by focusing on individual entities and their relationships, it became feasible. Similarly, the VBA automation was built piece by piece, function by function.

There were definitely moments of frustration. Debugging DAO recordset issues or complex SQL executed via VBA can be opaque. I spent more time than I'd like to admit staring at "Type Mismatch" errors or queries that returned no data for no apparent reason, only to find a misplaced comma or an incorrect field name.

If I were to do this again, I might explore using ADO instead of DAO for recordset manipulation, as I've read it can be more flexible, though DAO felt more native to Access. I would also implement more robust error logging from the start, rather than relying on `MsgBox` or `Debug.Print` so much.

Future enhancements?
*   **More Sophisticated Metrics:** Implementing more statistically robust VaR models or other risk measures like Conditional VaR or Beta. This would likely require more complex VBA or even integrating with an external library if possible, though that's beyond Access's typical scope.
*   **Parameterization:** Allowing users to select date ranges for reports or specify parameters for metric calculations (e.g., holding period for volatility).
*   **Actual Report Formatting:** I've mostly focused on calculating and storing data. The next step would be to properly design Access reports (using the Report Designer) that pull from `tblRiskReports` and present the information clearly. `DoCmd.OutputTo acOutputReport, , acFormatPDF, strReportPath` would be the command to look into for exporting.

Overall, I'm quite pleased with how this turned out. What used to be hours of manual work can now be done with a click of a button (albeit after ensuring the underlying market data is up-to-date). It's a practical demonstration of how even relatively "older" tools like Access can be leveraged to build powerful, time-saving applications, especially when you're working within certain constraints.
