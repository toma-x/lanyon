Hey everyone,

Keeping up with the latest research papers, especially in Computer Science fields on ArXiv, feels like trying to drink from a firehose. There's just so much interesting work coming out constantly! Reading abstracts helps, but sometimes you need a bit more substance to decide if a paper is worth a deep dive. I got tired of manually skimming, so I decided to embark on a project: building an AI agent that could autonomously fetch an ArXiv paper, understand its core content, and generate a decent summary.

My goal wasn't just a simple summary, but one that was contextually relevant and factually grounded in the paper's content. This led me down the path of using Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with a technique called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). I used Python, Langchain, an LLM API (thinking along the lines of powerful models like Gemini), and the FAISS library for vector storage.

## The Problem with Simple LLM Summaries

My first thought was: "Can't I just paste the paper text into an LLM like GPT-4 or Gemini and ask it to summarize?" Well, there are a few issues:

1.  **Context Window Limits:** Most LLMs have a limit on how much text they can process at once (the context window). Research papers are often way too long to fit entirely.
2.  **Loss of Specificity:** Even if you could fit it, the LLM might lose track of specific details or generate a summary that's too generic, missing the core nuances.
3.  **Potential Hallucinations:** While less common with factual text like papers, LLMs can sometimes "hallucinate" or make up information that wasn't actually in the source.

This is where **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** comes in.

## RAG to the Rescue!

The core idea of RAG is to give the LLM *relevant context* directly from the source document when it's generating the response. Instead of asking the LLM to summarize the *entire* paper from memory (which it can't do well), we:

1.  **Chunk:** Break the paper down into smaller, manageable pieces (chunks).
2.  **Embed:** Convert each chunk into a numerical representation (a vector embedding) that captures its semantic meaning.
3.  **Store:** Put these embeddings into a special database (a vector store) that allows efficient searching for similar content.
4.  **Retrieve:** When we want to summarize, we first search the vector store for chunks that are most relevant to the summarization task (or specific questions about the paper).
5.  **Augment & Generate:** We then feed these *retrieved chunks* along with our summarization prompt to the LLM. The LLM now has the specific, relevant context right in front of it to generate a much better, more grounded summary.

## My Project's Architecture

Hereâ€™s a rough flow of how my agent works:

1.  **Input:** Takes an ArXiv paper ID.
2.  **Fetch:** Downloads the PDF using the `arxiv` Python library.
3.  **Extract Text:** Pulls text content from the PDF (using `PyPDF2` or `PyMuPDF`).
4.  **Chunk Text:** Splits the extracted text into smaller, overlapping chunks (using Langchain's text splitters).
5.  **Embed Chunks:** Generates vector embeddings for each chunk using an embedding model (e.g., from Hugging Face's `sentence-transformers` or an API).
6.  **Index Chunks:** Stores these embeddings in a local FAISS vector store.
7.  **Retrieve Context:** Given the summarization goal, retrieves the most relevant chunks from FAISS based on semantic similarity.
8.  **Generate Summary:** Sends the retrieved chunks and a carefully crafted prompt to an LLM API (like those powering models such as Gemini) via Langchain.
9.  **Output:** Presents the final summary.

## Implementation Snippets and Decisions

Let's dive into some of the specific parts and the choices I made.

**1. Fetching and Extracting:**

Getting the paper was easy with the `arxiv` library. PDF text extraction, however, was the first hurdle. PDFs are messy! Tables, figures, multi-column layouts, equations... they don't always translate cleanly to plain text. I started with `PyPDF2` but found `PyMuPDF` often gave slightly better results, though neither was perfect.

```python
# Conceptual - Fetching and Basic Extraction
import arxiv
import fitz # PyMuPDF

def get_paper_text(arxiv_id):
    paper = next(arxiv.Client().results(arxiv.Search(id_list=[arxiv_id])))
    pdf_path = paper.download_pdf(dirpath="./papers", filename=f"{arxiv_id}.pdf")

    text = ""
    with fitz.open(pdf_path) as doc:
        for page in doc:
            text += page.get_text()
    return text

# paper_text = get_paper_text("some_arxiv_id") # Example ID like "2305.15334"
```
*Decision:* Stick with basic text extraction for now, accepting some level of messiness. More advanced PDF parsing exists but adds complexity.

**2. Chunking:**

LLMs need text in chunks. Langchain offers several ways to do this. I used the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, which tries to split text recursively based on characters like newlines and spaces, attempting to keep related pieces together. Overlapping chunks helps ensure context isn't lost at the boundaries.

```python
# Conceptual - Chunking with Langchain
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

def chunk_text(text):
    text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
        chunk_size=1000, # Max characters per chunk
        chunk_overlap=200, # Overlap between chunks
        length_function=len
    )
    chunks = text_splitter.split_text(text)
    # Langchain can also create Document objects directly
    # docs = text_splitter.create_documents([text])
    return chunks

# text_chunks = chunk_text(paper_text)
```
*Decision:* Use `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` as it's a good default. Tuning `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap` required some experimentation. Too small, and context is lost; too large, and you might exceed LLM limits or dilute relevance.

**3. Embedding and Vector Store (FAISS):**

This is the core of RAG. Each text chunk needs to become a vector. I used a sentence-transformer model available via Langchain's integrations (like `HuggingFaceEmbeddings`). For the vector store, I chose FAISS because it's efficient and runs locally, which is great for smaller projects without needing a separate database server.

```python
# Conceptual - Embedding and FAISS Store with Langchain
from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings # Or other embedding options
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.docstore.document import Document # Needed if not using create_documents earlier

# Assume text_chunks is a list of strings from chunk_text
# Convert chunks to Langchain Document objects if needed
documents = [Document(page_content=chunk) for chunk in text_chunks]

# Initialize embedding model
# model_name = "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2" # Example model
# embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name=model_name)

# Or use an API based embedding model
# embeddings = SomeCloudProviderEmbeddings()

# Create FAISS index from documents and embeddings
# vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(documents, embeddings)

# Save the index locally for later use
# vectorstore.save_local("faiss_index_arxiv")
```
*Decision:* Use a standard sentence-transformer model for embeddings initially. FAISS for local development simplicity. More powerful (and potentially costly) API-based embeddings could be swapped in.

**4. The RAG Chain:**

Langchain really shines here, making it easy to chain these steps together: retrieve from FAISS, format a prompt, and call the LLM.

```python
# Conceptual - Setting up the RAG chain
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.llms import GooglePalm # Example, could be OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini wrapper if available

# Load the FAISS index
# embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
# vectorstore = FAISS.load_local("faiss_index_arxiv", embeddings, allow_dangerous_deserialization=True) # Allow loading pickle

# Set up the retriever
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 5}) # Retrieve top 5 relevant chunks

# Define the prompt template
prompt_template = """Use the following pieces of context from a research paper to answer the question at the end.
Provide a concise summary focusing on the paper's core contributions, methodology, and key findings.
Do not just list the topics, synthesize them into a coherent summary.

Context:
{context}

Question: {question}

Concise Summary:"""
PROMPT = PromptTemplate(
    template=prompt_template, input_variables=["context", "question"]
)

# Initialize the LLM (using Google PaLM as an example placeholder for a powerful model)
# Make sure GOOGLE_API_KEY is set as an environment variable
# llm = GooglePalm(temperature=0.3) # Lower temperature for more factual summary

# Create the RetrievalQA chain
# qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
#     llm=llm,
#     chain_type="stuff", # "stuff" puts all retrieved chunks into the context
#     retriever=retriever,
#     chain_type_kwargs={"prompt": PROMPT},
#     return_source_documents=True # Optionally return which chunks were used
# )

# Run the chain to get the summary
# question = "Summarize this research paper."
# result = qa_chain({"query": question})
# summary = result['result']
# source_docs = result['source_documents'] # Useful for debugging

# print("Summary:", summary)
# print("Source Chunks Used:", len(source_docs))
```
*Decision:* Use Langchain's `RetrievalQA` chain with the `stuff` method (simplest way to combine context). Define a clear prompt instructing the LLM *how* to summarize using the provided context. Using an LLM API (like Google's, potentially accessing models like PaLM or Gemini) allows leveraging powerful models without hosting them myself. Setting `temperature` low helps keep the summary factual.

## Challenges I Faced

*   **PDF Mess:** As mentioned, getting clean text was tough. Tables, formulas, and references often got garbled, potentially impacting summary quality.
*   **Chunking Strategy:** Finding the sweet spot for `chunk_size` and `overlap` took trial and error. Sometimes important info was split awkwardly.
*   **Retrieval Tuning:** How many chunks (`k`) should the retriever fetch? Too few, and the LLM lacks context. Too many, and it might exceed the prompt limit or get distracted by less relevant info. I mostly stuck with k=5 or k=6.
*   **Prompt Engineering:** Getting the LLM to produce a *good* summary, not just list topics from the chunks, required careful prompt design. Explicitly asking for synthesis, core contributions, methodology, and findings helped.
*   **Evaluation:** How do you know if a summary is "good"? It's subjective! I mostly compared it to the abstract and my own skimming, but proper evaluation (like ROUGE scores) is complex.
*   **Resource Limits:** Running embeddings and FAISS locally was fine for single papers, but processing many papers could strain my laptop's RAM/CPU.

## Results and What I Learned

So, did it work? Yes, mostly! The RAG approach produced summaries that were *significantly* better than what I got by just prompting an LLM with maybe the first part of the paper. The summaries felt more grounded in the paper's actual content and often highlighted specific methods or results mentioned deep within the text.

**Example:** A non-RAG summary might just say "This paper discusses deep learning for image recognition." The RAG summary, having retrieved relevant chunks, might say something like: "This paper proposes a novel convolutional neural network architecture (XYZNet) which utilizes residual skip connections and attention mechanisms (details in context) to improve image classification accuracy on the ImageNet dataset, achieving a 5% higher top-1 accuracy than previous state-of-the-art methods." (This is hypothetical, but illustrates the difference in specificity).

**Key Learnings:**

*   **RAG is powerful:** It's a very practical way to make LLMs work better with specific documents.
*   **Langchain is helpful:** It provides great building blocks, but you still need to understand what each component does to use it effectively.
*   **The pipeline matters:** Each step (parsing, chunking, embedding, retrieving, prompting) influences the final output. Weaknesses early on (like bad PDF parsing) impact everything downstream.
*   **Iteration is key:** Tuning chunk sizes, retrieval parameters, and prompts is essential.
*   **Local vs. Cloud:** FAISS is great for starting locally, but for larger scale, managed vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.) would be necessary.

## Future Ideas

*   **Better PDF Parsing:** Explore tools specifically designed for academic PDF layout analysis (like Grobid).
*   **Smarter Retrieval:** Maybe use techniques that re-rank retrieved chunks or use hybrid search (keyword + semantic).
*   **Abstractive Summarization Focus:** Tune prompts specifically for more abstractive (less extractive) summaries while staying factual.
*   **Evaluation Framework:** Implement some automated evaluation metrics (e.g., ROUGE) alongside human judgment.

## Conclusion

This was a really fun and challenging project! It combined NLP, vector databases, LLMs, and software engineering (even if just in Python scripts). Building a RAG pipeline from scratch (with Langchain's help) gave me a much deeper appreciation for how these systems work under the hood. While my agent isn't perfect, it's a useful tool that demonstrates how combining retrieval with generation can lead to much more accurate and context-aware AI applications. Definitely learned a lot about the practical side of applying LLMs to real-world tasks!
